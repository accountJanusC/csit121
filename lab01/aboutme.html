            <p>
                Greetings! I am Janus, a student currently pursuing an Associates degree at CCBC. 
                I am starting relatively late in college due to having been sidelined
                for the past several years by OCD issues.

            <p>
                
             I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology (IT).

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
I'm in the IT program due to my interest in computer graphic design and
ethical hacking. In my spare time, I play tennis and other racquet sports. 
I sometimes listen to East Asian and Italian instrumental music while studying.
