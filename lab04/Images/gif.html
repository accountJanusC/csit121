		<h2>Why I Chose The GIF</h2>
		<p>American fimmaker Oliver Stone gave this speech for Born on the Fourth of July, which is admittedly
        not my favourite movie of his (I like Platoon more). I've chosen this GIF due to its significance in current
        events today, as wars both cold and hot are continuing to be waged for the reasons Stone has mentioned.</p>
		<h2>Reflection Pt. 3</h2>
		<p>I encountered no real problems in adding the GIF file. The harder part was finding a suitable GIF
        that would avoid copyright issues. Oscar speeches as part of a fairly well-known televised event would
        probably be ok in this regard.
