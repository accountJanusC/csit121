		<h2>Why I Chose The Image</h2>
		<p>I chose this image due to my fairly high regard for the Cowboy Bebop anime series, 
            particularly for its occasionally poignant themes and artistic direction.</p>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>In creating the home page for this lab, I familiarised myself with how to add a navigation bar
        as well as an image with the figure and figcaption elements. I originally prepared an embedded stylesheet,
        which ended up being a squandered effort since I later saw that an external one was preferred. I also found
        out that moving the images used here to the 'Images' folder caused it to fail to load, likely due to being
        unable to update the file path. Hence, I needed to keep both the image and html files all in the same folder.
