   <ol><h3 id="reflection_1-2">Reflecting on What I Learned</h3>
      <li>The first tidbit of unfamiliar material I was introduced to was <b>bolding</b> and <i>italicising</i> the text. 
      I learned there were differences between the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags as well as the &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags from a W3docs URL in the 'Structuring Text' section of Module 02.
      The W3docs article did not explain the differences in detail so I looked up other sources from the Stack Overflow and FreeCodecamp websites.
      <p>I found out the &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags should be used to convey actual emphasis which would be noticed in web browsers and search engines.
      They would impact how the the text would be read out for the visually impaired while the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags have no such effect.</p>
   </li>
   <br><li>I also learned from a CSIT 121 lecture about the tag for adding line breaks. <br><em>For line breaks like the one here for example</em>,
      if I want to shorten the amount of text in one line, simply pressing the Enter key is not going to do it.
      The 'Structuring Text' section in Module 02 notes that &lt;br&gt; is an empty tag that must be used in another element.
      </li>
   <br><li>A third aspect of HTML I familiarised myself with was adding hidden comments.<!--Just like the self-demonstrating one right here!--> 
      I found out how to do it from the HTML Tags Reference page on the W3Schools website. 
      The URL of the Tags Reference page was posted at the top of Module 02's 'Structuring Text' section.</li></ol>
    <ul> <h3>Reflecting on What I Had Trouble With</h3>
    <br><li>It took awhile for me to learn the proper way to use headings as well as the HTML format involving tags, attributes, and elements.
         I found out in the 'HTML Basics Notes' section of CSIT 121's Module 02 that the always lowercase opening tags come first, followed by the attributes, and then the elements.
         I still didn't quite understand attributes so the W3Schools tutorial section on it really helped explain its definition and layout.</li>
      <br><li>I was initially confused why the 'Structuring Text' section said not to use headings just for sizing, and reading a source from Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) helped me understand.
      The MDN article advised against using more than one &lt;h1&gt; element on the same page but others up to &lt;h6&gt; are allowed as long as they fit the page's information hierarchy.
      I've also learned that &lt;h7&gt; and above do not have meaning in HTML.
        Here are the webpages below which helped me understand how to format attributes and headings properly.</li>

      <ol><h3 id="reflection_3">Reflecting on Lab 3</h3>
      <br><li>In Module 03, we learned about CSS aka Cascading Style Sheets.
         And this assignment allowed me to further practice curly bracket and colon syntax for CSS.
       </li>
       <br><li>The Module and lectures on this topic also gave me knowledge on CSS formatting, notably the use of the 'link rel' combo to add a style sheet to an HTML page.
         In particular, the 'link' element should specify a file or resource while the 'rel' attribute should specify known values/keywords such as stylesheet, search, policy, alternate etc.
       </li></ol>
      <ul><h3>Reflecting on Lab 3 cont'd</h3>
      <br><li>However, I needed to find resources on my own to better understand how to use ID and class selectors since they were not covered in detail in both Module 02 and 03.
           I particularly needed to relearn the use of "#" before the ID selector and "." before the class selector.
         </li>
        <br><li>Here are the resources below which helped me understand CSS selectors and tags in general:
         <br><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/learn-css/css-id-and-class.html">CSS Class and ID by W3Docs</a>
         <br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors">CSS Selectors by MDN</a></li>

         <h2>Lab 5</h2>
   <p><i>Published on 2 March, 2025 by Janus in CSIT 121</i></p>
   <p class="first_subtitle">Adding CSS</p>
      </header>
      <ol><h3>Reflecting on Lab 5</h3><li>The Layout Lab, which mainly focused on modifying Labs 1-3, gave me experience in working with CSS grid syntax and helped me
         better understand the function of the &lt;div&gt; element. <p>But I had a bit of trouble in trying to add a separate heading/title
            to each column. I couldn't get the &lt;h3&gt; element to display at the top of each column when using &lt;p&gt; rather than &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;,
            so I needed to replace my 'paragraph' elements in the &lt;div&gt; with ''list' elements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>On what would be best design practices, I found
         the &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags key to preventing bullet points and numbered elements from turning into a lumpy block of text
         in each column. I also made sure most adjacent elements had contrasting background colours.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul><h3 id="reflection_5">Reflecting on Lab 5 cont'd</h3>
       <li>Furthermore, none of the Brightspace modules seemed to cover internal navigation with anchor links in much detail, so I
         needed to look up resources on my own to understand the syntax. 
        <p>This was also the case for media queries, where the Brightspace
         notes were not enough to make me understand this assignment's task. It also took me some time to notice that adding the
         query required an extra pair of curly brackets.
        </p>
      <p>Helpful resources that helped me understand media queries and anchor links were: <br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp">CSS3 Media Query Examples by W3Schools</a>
