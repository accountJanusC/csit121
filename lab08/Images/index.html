		<h2>Why I Chose The Image</h2>
		<p>I chose this image due to my fairly high regard for the Cowboy Bebop anime series, 
            particularly for its occasionally poignant themes and artistic direction.</p>
		<h2>Lab 04 Reflection</h2>
		<p>In creating the home page for this lab, I familiarised myself with how to add a navigation bar
        as well as an image with the figure and figcaption elements. I originally prepared an embedded stylesheet,
        which ended up being a squandered effort since I later saw that an external one was preferred. I also found
        out that moving the images used here to the 'Images' folder caused it to fail to load, likely due to being
        unable to update the file path. Hence, I needed to keep both the image and html files all in the same folder.
        </p>
        <h2>Lab 08 Reflection</h2>
		<p>To modify my navigation bar into one that is "sticky", I needed to familiarise
        myself with the W3Schools tutorial provided in the assignment description. I learned
        that the 2 most important aspects to create the sticky effect is setting the CSS position
        property to 'sticky'. The top property I also didn't understand so the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top">MDN article on it</a>
        helped me grasp how to toggle it to different locations. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp">W3Schools article on the overflow property</a>
        also helped me understand its purpose in my stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>I did not need to use JavaScript to create the sticky navbar. In the W3Schools tutorial,
        I initially had no idea what the javascript:void(0) syntax did but <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-void-keyword-explained/">a freeCodeCamp article</a>
        cleared things up in explaining that it serves to prevent reloading and navigation to other pages.
