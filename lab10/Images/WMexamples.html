		<h2>Concepts and W3C Guidelines</h2>
		<p>To fully understand and utilise the sending and receiving of Webmentions, one
        must understand the basics of HTTP requests. But first of all, you must be able
        to access either blogging software, plugins for software from content management systems
        or particular web services or APIs that can send and receive Webmentions. To preface,
        Webmentions are often sent with a "link rel" attribute. They involve the "source"
        parameter representing the sender's URL and the "target" parameter representing
        the receiver's URL. The @ symbol is usually used as well to create the linkback.
        </p>
        <p> For the
        &lt;a&gt; tag containing the link to a post you wants to send the Webmention to, you
        should add 'in reply to:' followed by &lt;a class="u-in-reply-to" before the href
        attribute. Then add an HTML class of "e-content" to &lt;p&gt; or some other tag
        representing the body of text. Put a &lt;div class="h-entry"&gt; around the message code
        to indicate the whole thing is a post.

        <p>Webmention.rocks is useful for testing your Webmention feature and checking for
        any errors.</p>
