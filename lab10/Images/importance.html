		<h2>Importance</h2>
		<p>Webmention allows for convenient communication between multiple websites
        or people without need for such third-party commenting systems (Codementor, 2023).
        They have been regarded as better and more secure than pingbacks, even by Pingbackâ€™s inventor,
        Stuart Landridge himself (Penland, 2017). IndieWeb's mission is to decentralise the web to
        make it more user-friendly and secure; Webmention is a nice addition to help promote their cause.
